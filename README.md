# Image-Processing #

##Image processing labs. Each method inside the Demo.java file applies a form of image processing to the image. ##

### Methods added so far: ### 

**Week 2:**

1. Image Pixel Value Re-Scaling: Re-scaling all the pixel values in an image and displaying the image
2. Image Pixel Value Shifting: Shifting all the pixel values in an image and displaying the image
3. Image Pixel Value Shifting and Re-Scaling: Add a random value to each pixel value, and then shift and re-scale all the pixel values in the image and display the image

**Week 3:**
1. Arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division of two images
2. Bitwise Boolean NOT operation: Bitwise NOT of one image. 
3. Bitwise Boolean operations: AND, OR and XOR of two images. 
4. ROI-based operations: Use a Black-and-White image as the Alpha channel for image processing. ROI stands for Region of Interest. 

**Week 4:**
1. Negative Linear Transform: apply negative linear function s = L-1-r to images.
2. Logarithmic function to images
3. Power-Law function to images
4. Random Look-up Table
5. bit-plane slicing

**Week 5:**
1. Finding Histogram
2. Histogram Normalisation
3. Histogram Equalisation
4. Histogram Displaying

**Week 6:**
* Image Convolution (I have also done correlation): Convoluting an image with a mask for smoothing and edge
detection:
1. Average 
2. Weighted average, 
3. 4 and 8 neighbour laplacian, 
4. 4 and 8 neighbour laplacian enhancement,
5. Roberts 1 and 2
6. Sobel x and y

**Week 7:**:
1. Salt-and-Pepper Noise adding
2. Min Filtering
3. Max Filtering
4. Midpoint Filtering
5. Median Filtering

**Week 8:**:
1. Mean and standard deviation of an image
2. Simple thresholding
3. Automated thresholding
