# Image-Proc
Image processing labs. Each method inside the Demo.java file applies a form of image processing to the image. 

Methods added so far: 

Week #2:
Image Pixel Value Re-Scaling: Re-scaling all the pixel values in an image and displaying the image
Image Pixel Value Shifting: Shifting all the pixel values in an image and displaying the image
Image Pixel Value Shifting and Re-Scaling: Add a random value to each pixel value, and then shift and re-scale all the pixel values in the image and display the image

Week #3:
Arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division of two images
Bitwise Boolean NOT operation: Bitwise NOT of one image. 
Bitwise Boolean operations: AND, OR and XOR of two images. 
ROI-based operations: Use a Black-and-White image as the Alpha channel for
image processing. ROI stands for Region of Interest. 

Week #4
Negative Linear Transform: apply negative linear function s = L-1-r to images.
Logarithmic function to images
Power-Law function to images
Random Look-up Table
bit-plane slicing

Week #5:
Finding Histogram
Histogram Normalisation
Histogram Equalisation
Histogram Displaying

Week #6:
Image Convolution: Convoluting an image with a mask for smoothing and edge
detection:
Average, Weigted average, 
4 and 8 neighbour laplacian, 
4 and 8 neighbour laplacian enhancement,
Roberts 1 and 2,
Sobel x and y

Week #7:
